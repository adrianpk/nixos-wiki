This page describes the on-going work to provide a more secure version
of NixOS, similar in goals to the Hardened Gentoo project ([wiki page
1](http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened_Gentoo), [wiki page
2](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Hardened)), but applied to the
base NixOS system instead.

Developed features

Currently, no feature is completely developed and ready to be used in
production.

Features in development
-----------------------

### grsecurity/PaX

[grsecurity](https://grsecurity.net/) is a Linux kernel patch which adds
a large number of optional security enhancements to both the kernel
itself and userspace programs. It's main focus is in preventing the
successful execution of (known and unknown) exploits, although it also
has its own optional Role-Based Access Control mechanism (RBAC), similar
in goals to AppArmor and SELinux.

You can read a full (and quite extensive) list of grsecurity's features
here:
[[1]](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Grsecurity/Appendix/Grsecurity_and_PaX_Configuration_Options)
You can find more of its documentation here:
[[2]](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Grsecurity)

Note that this feature is still a work in progress and there are known
unfixed issues (detailed below). Please do not use it unless you expect
breakage, and wish to contribute with bug reports or wish to develop it
further.

#### How to use grsecurity

As of November 2013, grsecurity has 2 available versions: a stable patch
for kernel 3.2 and a test patch for kernel 3.11.

This is an example excerpt of configuration.nix which enables the stable
grsecurity patch:

       nixpkgs.config = {
         grsecurity = true;
       
         packageOverrides = pkgs: {
           linuxPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_3_2_grsecurity;
       
           stdenv = pkgs.stdenv // {
             platform = pkgs.stdenv.platform // {
               kernelExtraConfig = ''
                 XEN n
                 HIBERNATION n
                 DEVKMEM? n
                 GRKERNSEC y
                 GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO y
                 GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_DESKTOP y
                 GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_VIRT_HOST y
                 GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_VIRT_EPT y
                 GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_VIRT_KVM y
                 GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_PRIORITY_SECURITY y
                 GRKERNSEC_PROC_USER y
                 GRKERNSEC_PROC_GID 0
                 GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_CHMOD n
                 GRKERNSEC_SYSCTL n
               '';
             };
           };
         };
       };

Please read grsecurity's documentation at
[[3]](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Grsecurity/Appendix/Grsecurity_and_PaX_Configuration_Options)
in order to properly configure your kernel.

Configuration tips:

-   There are 2 main ways of configuring grsec: "GRKERNSEC\_CONFIG\_AUTO
    y", which tries to set up some reasonable defaults, or
    "GRKERNSEC\_CONFIG\_CUSTOM y", which disables everything and you
    must enable all needed features manually.
-   Unless you wish to enable only a few features, or you are very
    persistent and wish to configure all options one-by-one, it's
    probably better to use "GRKERNSEC\_CONFIG\_AUTO y".
-   When using "GRKERNSEC\_CONFIG\_AUTO y", you must select all of the
    following:
    -   "GRKERNSEC\_CONFIG\_SERVER y" or "GRKERNSEC\_CONFIG\_DESKTOP y",
        depending on whether your system is a server or desktop.
    -   "GRKERNSEC\_CONFIG\_VIRT\_NONE y",
        "GRKERNSEC\_CONFIG\_VIRT\_GUEST y" or
        "GRKERNSEC\_CONFIG\_VIRT\_HOST y", depending on whether your
        system doesn't use virtualization, is a guest or is a
        virtualization host (respectively).
        -   If you use virtualization, "GRKERNSEC\_CONFIG\_VIRT\_EPT y"
            or "GRKERNSEC\_CONFIG\_VIRT\_SOFT y", depending on whether
            your CPU has hardware virtualization extensions or not
            (respectively).
        -   If you use virtualization, "GRKERNSEC\_CONFIG\_VIRT\_XEN y",
            "GRKERNSEC\_CONFIG\_VIRT\_VMWARE y",
            "GRKERNSEC\_CONFIG\_VIRT\_KVM y" or
            "GRKERNSEC\_CONFIG\_VIRT\_VIRTUALBOX y", depending on which
            virtualization software you use.
    -   "GRKERNSEC\_CONFIG\_PRIORITY\_PERF y" or
        "GRKERNSEC\_CONFIG\_PRIORITY\_SECURITY y", depending on whether
        performance or security is the highest priority (respectively).
-   Disabling the XEN, HIBERNATION and DEVKMEM features allows
    grsecurity to enable additional (and important) security
    enhancements, so be sure to explicitly disable them if you don't use
    them.
-   **You must** use "GRKERNSEC\_CHROOT\_CHMOD n" in your kernel config
    if you wish to use Nix to build software on your system (most people
    do). This line is not needed if instead you build software using
    NixOps from another machine (and users of the target system don't
    need to install software using Nix).
-   **You must** either use "GRKERNSEC\_SYSCTL n" in the kernel
    configuration or 'boot.kernel.sysctl."kernel.grsecurity.grsec\_lock"
    = 1;' in your configuration.nix, so that an attacker cannot disable
    grsecurity protections easily.
