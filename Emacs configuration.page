Find elisp modules in standard profiles (outdated)
--------------------------------------------------

     (setq load-path (append (list "~/.nix-profile/share/emacs/site-lisp" "/var/run/current-system/sw/share/emacs/site-lisp") load-path))

For a while, the emacs expression installs a site-start.el that uses
NIX\_PROFILES as base for extending the load-path

Tramp
-----

Tramp needs to call \`ls\` and \`id\` but it will not find them on a
NixOS machine without additional configuration because they are not in
the usual places. To fix this you can add the following to your
\~/.emacs

    (require 'tramp) 
    (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path "/var/run/current-system/sw/bin")

You can then edit local files as root e.g.

    C-x C-f /su::/etc/nixos/configuration.nix

To login to a remote NixOS machine which uses port 1234 for ssh:

    C-x C-f /ssh:username@hostname#1234:/

Enable Nix mode
---------------

The library is in the file
`/var/run/current-system/sw/share/emacs/site-list/nix-mode.el`.

Load the library with `M-x load-library<ENTER>nix-mode<ENTER>`, and then
enable the mode for the current buffer with `M-x nix-mode`.

Add to .emacs with the following line:

     (require 'nix-mode)

This loads the library on every startup, and installs mode hooks that
enables the mode for files with a file name extension *.nix*, or
*.nix.in*.

Or, if lazy loading of the library is preferred, add to .emacs the
following lines:

     (autoload 'nix-mode "nix-mode" "Major mode for editing Nix expressions." t)
     (push '("\\.nix\\'" . nix-mode) auto-mode-alist)
     (push '("\\.nix.in\\'" . nix-mode) auto-mode-alist)

The first line makes the command `nix-mode` automatically load the
library, and the last two install the same file name extensions as above
in the mode hooks.
