Tramp
-----

Tramp needs to call \`ls\` and \`id\` but it will not find them on a
NixOS machine without additional configuration because they are not in
the usual places. To fix this you can add the following to your
\~/.emacs (require 'tramp) (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path
"/var/run/current-system/sw/bin")

You can then edit local files as root e.g. C-x C-f
/su::/etc/nixos/configuration.nix

Nix mode
--------

(load-library "nix-mode")
