What can theoretically cause different build results?

-   current date
-   cpu
-   RAM available
-   fileystem
-   kernel running the builds [1]
-   is a virtualization system being usedÂ ?
-   sensors (such as temperature)
-   timing behaviour of any component in use (fs, ..) (causing timeouts
    and such)

[1] quoting Lluis Batlle:

We have the kernelHeaders. Programs should respect kernelHeaders for the
kernel API, and not talk to the running kernel.

-   gconf runs in daemon mode
-   qt -running qgit

runtime impurities
------------------

Stateful directories in NixOS: /etc, /var, /home can cause packages to
do what they usually do. In case of trouble make a backup, delete and
recreate those to trouble shoot a problem.
