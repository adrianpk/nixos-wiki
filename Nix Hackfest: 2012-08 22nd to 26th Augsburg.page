Leave a comment here if you are interested in attending a
[hackfest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) in Augsburg (or
possibly Munich), Germany (6-9th July?) or participating remotely.
Include your name or nick and mention what you would like to work on in
particular. Try to include some detail if the topic requires an
introduction for others, pointers to mailing list discussions, tickets
etc. could also be helpful. We don't all have to work on the same thing,
but it is good to take advantage of having people around to flesh things
out.

Improve python support
----------------------

Work on solving some of the following issues

-   Python package impurity (stop packages from trying to install
    dependencies)
-   Run the package tests (currently most of them are disabled because
    they don't work)
-   Write nix tests which test that the python modules work (to some
    degree)
-   Look at generating nix expressions from pypi (see MarcWeber's work
    on this)

-   <https://github.com/chaoflow/nixpkgs> (python branch)
-   <https://gitorious.org/nixpkgs-python-overlay>

Package Tracking System
-----------------------

If I understand correctly the idea is to create some utilities to test
the kwalitee of Nix package expressions, perhaps tied in with additional
metadata. Aszlig mentioned it on IRC:
