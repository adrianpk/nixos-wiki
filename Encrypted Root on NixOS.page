There are many possible encrypted root setups. This guide is for setting
up LVM over Luks, which is an easy and safe setup that will satisfy most
users. Other setups should still be sufficiently similar.

Important
---------

Here you will find \*only\* NixOS-specific bits. For general information
regarding this setup, how to partition disks and such refer to
[[1]](http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_Encryption_with_LUKS_for_dm-crypt)
or other detailed guide.

Updating from how it was previously
-----------------------------------

Luks got changed lately (see mailinglist from 3.3.2012 titled "[Nix-dev]
luks changes")

     If you had:
     boot.initrd.luksRoot = "/dev/sda2";
     
     Then now you have to write:
     boot.initrd.luks.enable = true;
     boot.initrd.luks.devices = [ { name = "luksroot"; device = "/dev/sda2"; } ];

the configuration of /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
-------------------------------------------------

In this example we assume that:

-   your **boot partition** is **/dev/sda1** and
-   your **luks-encrypted partition** is **/dev/sda2** that contains the
    LVM volume group "vg".

### Make sure initrd finds and mounts the root partition

      boot.initrd.luks.enable = true;
      boot.initrd.luks.devices = [ { name = "luksroot"; device = "/dev/sda2"; } ];

Additionally you can encrypt your /home partition or any other partition
with a different luks container, then use:

      boot.initrd.postDeviceCommands = "cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda3 lukshome";

**Note: don't forget the kernel modules listed below**

### no encrypted root filesystem, no encrypted swap but only encrypted /home

If you **only want to have an encrypted home directory**, you need to
set:

      boot.initrd.luks.enable = true;
      boot.initrd.postDeviceCommands = "cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda3 lukshome";

**Note: don't forget the kernel modules listed below**

### Extra kernel modules you might need

Depending on the encryption algorithm you have chosen for your Luks
volume, you will probably need to ensure kernel has the necessary crypto
modules.

If you are unsure which ones, run

    cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda2

What you are looking for is this:

    LUKS header information for /dev/sda2

    Version:        1
    Cipher name:    aes
    Cipher mode:    cbc-essiv:sha256
    Hash spec:      sha1

In this example you need SHA1, SHA256, AES, and CBC.

You can put the required crypto modules into initrd along with dm\_crypt
module needed by Luks like this:

    boot.initrd.kernelModules = ["dm_crypt" "aes-i586" "sha256" "sha1" "cbc"];

On my 64bit system (2.6.32) I needed this modules instead the listed
above:

    boot.initrd.kernelModules = ["dm_crypt" "sha256_generic" "sha1_generic" "cbc" "aes_x86_64" "aes_generic" "xts" ];

 Note that some USB keyboards also need special kernel support, which
must be available in the init ramdisk to enter the pass phrase. Recent
models of the Microsoft Internet keyboard, for example, need the module
`hid_microsoft` in order to be recognized as an input device.

### Root Filesystem

      fileSystems = [ {
        mountPoint = "/";
        device = "/dev/mapper/vg-root";
        #device = "/dev/mapper/luksroot"; # use this instead when NOT using LVM
      } {
        mountPoint = "/boot";
        device = "/dev/sda1";
      }
      #other filesystems go here 
      ]

Mounting from a rescue system
-----------------------------

Within the rescue system:

      # cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda2 crypt
      # vgscan
      # vgchange -ay

Now your logical volumes should be available.
