The intention of this article is to provide a walk through tutorial for
the Nix expression language in addition to practical tips and advice for
writing and debugging Nix expressions. The canonical documentation is
the [Nix Users
Manual](http://hydra.nixos.org/job/nix/trunk/tarball/latest/download-by-type/doc/manual%7C).
Please refer to *5.2. The Nix expression language* for further details.

The Nix Expression Language
---------------------------

There isn't an interactive interpreter for Nix, but \`nix-instantiate
--eval-only -\` can be used to quickly test an expression:

    $ nix-instantiate --eval-only -
    rec {x = 123;}.x
    <Ctrl-D>
    123
