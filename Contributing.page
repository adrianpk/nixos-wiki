How to write a patch ?
----------------------

quick & dirty: copy paste existing code and make it fit your needs.

Additionally you should read various docs:

(TODO complete this list and put in proper urls to the final document
rather than the xml sources)

Source:

-   NIXPKGS\_REPO/maintainers/\*
-   NIXPKGS\_REPO/doc/\*

Eg doc/coding-conventions.xml

I have a patch
--------------

Thanks. Send it to the mailinglist so that we can discuss and apply it.

Howto get access to SVN ?
-------------------------

DRAFT:

Run for an SVN account by writing to the mailinglist. Eelco Dolstra (irc
nick: niksnut) is responsible. In the past everyone got access who
proofed that he / she has been interested in the project for some time.
Proofing this can be done by

-   reading the documentation and the mailinglist
-   participating in discussions on irc
-   asking and replying to questions on the mailinglist
-   send patches to the mailinglist and read the feedback you get

PATCHES
-------

DRAFT: If you break things don't scream if someone reverts it. This
happened some times in the past. The best thing to do then is fixing
your patch. If it causes a lot of rebuilds commit it to the
stdenv-updates branch

If you break things ask on the mailinglist and or contact the author of
the code you break before comitting. Eg you can use svn annotate to get
to know who comitted a line.

Sander: Suggestion: maybe someone should verify what the impact is of a
change by checking the build job status on [[1]](http://hydra.nixos.org)

HOW to verify that you didn't break evaluation by accident ?
------------------------------------------------------------

To find out which packages are effected by your change:

    $ nix-env -f . -qaP \* --drv-path | sort > l1
    (...modify package...)
    $ nix-env -f . -qaP \* --drv-path | sort > l2
    $ changed=$(diff l1 l2 | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq)

    # This list can be used to create a release.nix for testing you can build all the relevant packages
    $ nix-build $(for i in $changed; do echo -A $i; done)

    #!/bin/sh
    set -e -x

    export NIXOS=${NIXOS:-/etc/nixos/nixos}
    export NIXPKGS_ALL=${NIXPKGS_ALL:-/etc/nixos/nixpkgs}

    # evaluate all derivations found in all-packages.nix:
    nix-env -qa '*' --show-trace -P --out-path -f $NIXPKGS_ALL/pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix

    # evaluate all derivations found in release.nix before starting the build:
    # nix-env -qa '*' $NIXPKGS_ALL/pkgs/top-level/release.nix
    # nix-instantiate --readonly-mode $NIXPKGS_ALL/pkgs/top-level/release.nix --show-trace

    # build a release tarball which contains the most important packages (?)
    nix-build -A tarball $NIXOS/release.nix --show-trace

TODO: explain what is done exactly

 The nixpkgs-dev-utilities referenced on [Nix(OS) related repositories
and work](//Nix(OS) related repositories and work) tries to implement
this for your convinience
