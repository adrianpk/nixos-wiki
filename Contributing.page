I have a patch
--------------

Thanks. Send it to the mailinglist so that we can discuss and apply it.

Howto get access to SVNÂ ?
-------------------------

DRAFT:

Run for an SVN account by writing to the mailinglist. Eelco Dolstra (irc
nick: niksnut) is responsible. In the past everyone got access who
proofed that he / she has been interested in the project for some time.
Proofing this can be done by

-   reading the documentation and the mailinglist
-   participating in discussions on irc
-   asking and replying to questions on the mailinglist
-   send patches to the mailinglist and read the feedback you get

PATCHES
-------

DRAFT: If you break things don't scream if someone reverts it. This
happened some times in the past. The best thing to do then is fixing
your patch. If it causes a lot of rebuilds commit it to the
stdenv-updates branch

If you break things ask on the mailinglist and or contact the author of
the code you break before comitting. Eg you can use svn annotate to get
to know who comitted a line.
