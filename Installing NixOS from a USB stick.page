It is possible to install NixOS from a USB stick, rather than from a CD.
This is useful if you want to install NixOS on a machine that doesn't
have a CD-ROM drive (such as most netbooks), or if you don't want to
waste a blank CD. Here is how to do it:

1.  Download a [NixOS ISO image](http://nixos.org/nixos/download.html).
2.  Obtain a USB stick formatted with the VFAT/FAT32 filesystem with
    enough free disk space to hold the contents of the ISO image. Note
    that it's not necessary to erase the USB stick.
3.  Install [UNetbootin](http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/), a tool
    that allows you to create a bootable USB stick from an ISO image.
    UNetbootin runs on both Linux and Windows. If you already have
    Nix/NixOS, you can install it by running `nix-env -i unetbootin`.
    [Other
    tools](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tools_to_create_Live_USB_systems)
    may also work.
4.  Insert the USB stick, start UNetbootin, select the ISO file and
    target USB drive, and press Ok. This copies the contents of the ISO
    to the USB stick and installs the GRUB boot loader.
5.  You should now be able to boot NixOS from the USB stick, and perform
    the installation as usual.
