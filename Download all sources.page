Here is a one-liner for downloading all the source dependencies of a
package:

nix-store -r $(grep -l outputHash $(nix-store -qR
$(nix-instantiate '<nixpkgs>' -A geeqie) | grep '.drv$'))

Here's how it works:

-   \$(nix-instantiate '\<nixpkgs\>' -A geeqie): instantiate geeqie into
    .drv files and print the file names
-   $(nix-store -qR PREVIOUS | grep '.drv$'): print all
    references/requirements of the above and keep only the .drv files
    (which is where static derivations live)
-   \$(grep -l outputHash PREVIOUS): keep only the source derivations,
    since those will have a predefined hash of the output
-   nix-store -r PREVIOUS: realize those derivations, downloading all
    sources and storing them in the nix store

PhewÂ :-)
