Sometimes we need to download all source dependencies of a package. An
example is if a long build is being planned, so we first download all
needed files - and after that we only need to worry about local
(non-Internet) issues.

Here is a one-liner for downloading all the source dependencies of a
package (thanks Eelco Dolstra!):

$> nix-store -r $(grep -l outputHash $(nix-store -qR $(nix-instantiate
'\<nixpkgs\>' -A geeqie) | grep '.drv\$'))

Explaining how it works:

-   **\$(nix-instantiate '\<nixpkgs\>' -A geeqie)**: instantiate geeqie
    into .drv files and print the file names
-   **$(nix-store -qR PREVIOUS | grep '.drv$')**: print all
    references/requirements of the above and keep only the .drv files
    (which is where static derivations live)
-   **\$(grep -l outputHash PREVIOUS)**: keep only the source
    derivations, since those will have a predefined hash of the output
-   **nix-store -r PREVIOUS**: realize those derivations, downloading
    all sources and storing them in the nix store

After that, all sources will be locally stored!

Phew!
