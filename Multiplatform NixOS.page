Overview
========

The current supported platforms are:

-   PC (i686-linux, x86\_64-linux)
-   Sheevaplug (armv5tel-linux)
-   Fuloong Mini-PC (mips64, with mips n32 binaries) - Only in
    stdenv-updastes

Fuloong Mini-PC
===============

Installation
------------

I will describe the procedure to install NixOS through the network,
although a bootable USB could work.

Requirements:

-   A TFTP server
-   An NFS server
-   Download the [system
    tarball](http://vicerveza.homeunix.net/~viric/tmp/nix/nixos-system-mips64-linux.tar.xz)
    and unpack it somewhere accessible by the NFS client you will have
    in your Fuloong Mini-PC

Procedure:

In the PC, lets prepare the files you will serve by NFS

-   Read the kernel-parameters.txt. Notice there is a mention to an
    init-stage2.sh file and a system directory, both in the store path.
-   Make symbolic links to those paths in /boot/init and
    /boot/init-stage2.sh. Something like this:

<!-- -->

    ln -s /nix/store/41x8chz5mwf3nwxd7460skz291fyvml7-stage-2-init.sh boot/init
    ln -s /nix/store/rmc2a3w0c10rwhad7493scqcrh5b0dkc-system boot/system

-   Disable the start of dhclient, editing
    nix/store/\*upstart-dhclient.conf and commenting the line starting
    with "start on"
-   Copy the file boot/vmlinux to your TFTP server root

In the Fuloong2f:

-   Boot PMON (turn on the computer), and enter its command line mode
    using a USB keyboard and pressing at boot time the DELETE key. You
    will get a prompt.
-   Give your system an IP (use 'devls' to know about your NIC device
    name)

<!-- -->

    ifaddr rtk0 192.168.1.223

-   Get the kernel through tftp, where TFTPIP is your tftp server ip

<!-- -->

    load tftp://TFTPIP/vmlinux

-   Boot the kernel, where NFSIP:NFSPATH is your nfsroot mount point,
    and IP is the ip of your computer

<!-- -->

    g console=tty nfsroot=NFSIP:NFSPATH root=/dev/nfs ip=IP init=/boot/init systemConfig=/boot/system

After this, you will have a running NixOS, where you can use the usual
nixos-install procedures as described in the NixOS manual installing
from a bootable CD.

Configuration details
---------------------

In your configuration.nix, you have to pay attention to these basics to
get a bootable system. We are going to use the 'generationsDir' boot
method, that simply puts the necessary files to load into known paths.
You will have to configure your usual PMON /boot/boot.cfg pointing to
the proper config.
