is however not the Linux kernel and we have standards here. As such
most, if not all, will be edited out in the "final version"**

UDX stands for "User & Developer eXperience" and this page features a
set of easy to remember guidelines for how to illustrate solutions to
problems or how to properly write documentation. It contains simple ways
of creating a readable and structured documents or even approaches to
conversations in regards to using, maintaining and developing for
Nix(OS), Linux or KDE. By following these guidelines verbatim we can
ensure an easy learning curve for the newly initiated and clean, uniform
and semantic documentation for all.

You catch more bee's with honey, and people comprehend subjects much
more easily when they are at ease (though it can also be said that
"extreme motivation" can get people to do "the darndest things").
Shakespear also said that "brevity is the soul of wit", meaning that if
you keep it "short and sweet" the point will be ever ever oh so more
clearer to the listener or reader (that hypocritical immortal bard...!)
I often catch my self rambling on, editing documents from being huge
stacks of "papers" to a couple of papers or two of concise and direct
information. This is because we don't have time to read all this fancy
language; what is the function behind it? What is it you are trying to
communicate? In other words...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A simple rule of thumb about everything: "if you can't explain something
as if you're talking to a child you haven't understood the process fully
yourself" (provided the child has an open mind and good math skills). Of
course this is just a short and sweet statement that deals with a very
important subject, and that's Keep It Simple, Stupid. We all have a
tendency to overthink things. How to live, how to work, how to love, and
even how to code and document. Sometimes you need to step back and ask
your self: "Am I over-thinking this?" Chances are you're right at least
half of the time.

In regards to simple questions being asked:

-   If you were asked a question, did the person asking provide you with
    all the necessary information?
-   If you were asked a question, is the person fixated on a possible
    solution to a problem without having enough evidence to suggest that
    the person has confirmed that this maybe the case?
-   If you were asked a question, does it seem like the person is
    confusing terms?

In any which case; ask them to tell you their direct issue, to explain
in simple terms what they are trying to achieve.

But then again...

When dealing with computers it's easy to forget that some people just
don't know what they're doing (\<-Psst.. this hypocrite right here).
Shut up, parentheses! So it's good to actually be be a bit verbose as
you are concise. You're not going to explain every feature or function
of a program or procedure, but to at least explain each step with enough
context to help someone who is not informed learn more about their
operating system environment. For example:

Let's take a very simple command, say **nix-env -i**. In this case the
explanation is either way simple "installs a package", or you could try
to explain the process of nix-env -i verbatum, as easy and simple as
possible, for educational purposes.
