There is one attribute on `configuration.nix` which is expected to
system-wide disable IPv6:

    networking.enableIPv6 = false;

This alone does not prevent my network interfaces from acquiring a
default IPv6 address at boot time. Then there is this other way to
request the kernel to avoid loading IPv6 support:

    boot.extraKernelParams = [ "ipv6.disable=1" ];

The additional parameter will get added to the kernel line in the grub
configuration file.

**Note**: Please have a look at the [discussion
page](//Talk:Disabling IPv6) before applying this method.
