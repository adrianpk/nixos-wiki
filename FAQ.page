Frequently asked questions and common newcomer trouble should be put
here so that we can point to this page intsead of answering the same
question over and over again.

There may be a different cause (out of memory) You can check
/var/log/messages to see if there is something about the OOM killer
kicking in

-   Nix(OS) substitutes break on older
    [Btrfs](http://en.wikipedia.org/Btrfs) implementation since the
    merge of SQLite support (feb 2011 in trunk).

Subtituted files are padded by zero bytes, which makes them unusable.
Upgrading Btrfs to 2.6.37+ kernel resolves the issue.

-   Using nix to install new software requires to download the source
    from upstream and sometimes that source has moved and therefore the
    download won't work but after some google search with:
    'myfile-0.1.2.tar.gz "index of"' one usually can find the file an
    download it manually.

to move that file into the sore one can use: nix-prefetch-url
file://myfile-0.1.2.tar.gz if the file is in the current directory
