Frequently asked questions and common newcomer trouble should be put
here so that we can point to this page intsead of answering the same
question over and over again.

NixOS segfaults when running on VirtualPC:
------------------------------------------

You may have hit
<http://jagbarcelo.blogspot.com/2009/11/segmentation-fault-ubuntu-virtual-pc.html>
There may be a different cause (out of memory) You can check
/var/log/messages to see if there is something about the OOM killer
kicking in

Nix(OS) substitutes break on older [Btrfs](http://en.wikipedia.org/Btrfs) implementation since the merge of SQLite support (feb 2011 in trunk)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subtituted files are padded by zero bytes, which makes them unusable.
Upgrading Btrfs to 2.6.37+ kernel resolves the issue.

Using nix to install new software requires to download the source from upstream and sometimes that source has moved and therefore the download won't work but after some google search with: 'myfile-0.1.2.tar.gz "index of"' one usually can find the file an download it either:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   download manually and copy into /tmp, then:

to move that file into the store one can use:

     nix-prefetch-url file:///tmp/myfile-0.1.2.tar.gz if the file is in the /tmp directory

-   download directly

<!-- -->

     nix-prefetch-url "http://myfoohost.com/programs/foo/myfile-0.1.2.tar.gz"

How to restart an UPSTART service
---------------------------------

either:

     restart sshd 

or

     initctl restart sshd

How to keep build-time dependencies around / be able to rebuild while being offline
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

configuration.nix:

     nix.extraOptions = 
       gc-keep-outputs = true
       gc-keep-derivations = true
     ;

Check 'man configuration.nix' for these options. Rebuild for these
options to take effect:

     # nixos-rebuild switch

List all store paths that form the system closure and realise them:

     $ nix-store -qR $(nix-instantiate /etc/nixos/nixos -A system) | xargs nix-store -r

Same for your user profile:

     $ nix-store -qR ~/.nix-profile |xargs nix-store -r

Repeat for further profiles you might have. Consult man pages of
nix-store and nix-instantiate for further information.
