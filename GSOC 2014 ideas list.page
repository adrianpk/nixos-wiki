Want to spend your summer contributing full-time to NixOS and get paid
for it?

Most ideas listed here have a contact person associated with them.
Please get in touch with them earlier rather than later to develop your
idea into a complete application. You can find many of them on
Freenode's IRC network under the same username. If there is no contact
information, please join the nix-dev mailing list or \#nixos on the
Freenode IRC network, and we will work with you to find a mentor and
discuss your idea.

You don't have to apply for one of these ideas! You can come up with
your own, and as long as it fits into Nix stack, we'll be happy to work
with you to develop it. Remember, your project needs to have
deliverables in less than 3 months of work in most cases. Be ambitious
but not too ambitious ;)

Ideas

### Packaging Gnome 3

While there's been initial work done to have a minimal gnome-shell
running, we're far from claiming support of Gnome 3.

To get a better idea what's done and what's left to be acomplished, see
<https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/247>

### Improving Python support

Currently we have python 2.6 - 3.3 and PyPy support in Nix. Improving
Python support is an on-going effort
<https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/1467>, but much more could be
done.

Improvements:

-   add modules support for python 3 and PyPy
-   write documentation (packaging for python currently almost doesn't
    have any)
-   convert buildPythonPackage to python.mkDerivation
-   produce usable pypi2nix script <https://github.com/garbas/pypi2nix>
-   split out usable functions for software having python bindings but
    not using distutils/setuptools
-   make \`python-packages.nix\` self referential and being able to use
    \`pythonPackages.pyramid.override\` function
-   make python software developemnt usable with nix-shell
