I have a netbook which I use to connect to my WPA2-protected wifi
network at home. Here is my experience of setting up wicd and wireless
connection.

### Check the hardware

Check that your wireless adapter is working

    [root@pokemon:~]# ifconfig -a | grep -A 5 wlan
    wlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:16:EB:19:DC:A0  
              BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
              RX packets:25756 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
              TX packets:22685 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
              collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
              RX bytes:7196191 (6.8 Mb)  TX bytes:7611727 (7.2 Mb)

If not, consult dmesg. One possible reason is missing firmware.
Sometimes you may need to enable it explicitly, see
networking.enableIntel2100BGFirmware option as an example.

### Enable wicd, disable other networking

Wicd is fully-functional network manager, it takes responsibility for
connecting, launching dhcp clients, storing passwords, etc. To prevent
conflicts, disable other network agents

    networking = {
      ...
      interfaceMonitor.enable = false;
      wireless.enable = false; # Don't run wpa_supplicant (wicd will do it when necessary)
      useDHCP = false; # Don't run dhclient on wlan0
      wicd.enable = true;
      ...
    };

(Roconnor 2012-08-13: setting useDHCP to false breaks for me in that
wicd never sets the DNS server. Sergey 2013-06: confirm, that seems to
be a dhcpcd issue. Wicd better works with dhclient.)

### Setup wicd

Now rebuild nixos, switch to new configuration and launch the gui.

    	$ wicd-gtk

Notes:

-   If it doesn't see wireless networks, open preferences and check
    wireless interface name. Enter correct value (like "wlan0") if
    needed.
-   Currently, wicd better works with dhclient. Better enable it in
    preferences

<!-- -->

     instead of dhcpcd.

That's it. Now use gui to find your network, enter passwords and connect
to it.
