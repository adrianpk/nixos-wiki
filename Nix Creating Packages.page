Quick Guide
-----------

What you need to quickly test building packages is already on the
system. There are various ways to approach this, but for brevity, ease
of use and educational purposes we will use nixos-rebuild to test our
packages. This guide will teach you who set up a quick testing
environment, using the current (14.04) NixOS channel as a source for the
scaffolding.

**1. Open a terminal**

Press `(KeyCmb: ALT+F2, write "konsole" and press enter)`

**2. Setup a directory or folder for *"nixpkgs"*.**

Let's put it inside a folder called *"Builds"* in your *[Home
Folder](/w/index.php?title=NixOS_User_Reference&action=edit&redlink=1 "NixOS User Reference (page does not exist)")*.

**In Dolphin**

Open Dolphin `(KeyCmb: ALT+F2, write "Dolphin" and press enter)` and
select the home directory. Create a Builds folder and create the nixpkgs
folder inside of that folder

* * * * *

***In Terminal***

`mkdir -p /home/$USER/Builds/nixpkgs`

* * * * *

 **2. Find the nixpkgs channel stored in NixOS**

Switch to an open terminal

**Echo the NIX\_PATH**

Simply run `echo $NIX_PATH`, which should output something like this:

`/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels/nixos:nixpkgs=/etc/nixos/nixpkgs:nixos-config=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`

Here we can see that `nixpkgs=/etc/nixos/nixpkgs` is a virtual directory
(or symlinked directory) that leads to the current active set of
channels that provides the various versions and iterations of `nixpkgs`.

Quick Guide Notes
-----------------

Re: **mkdir -p**

> *mkdir stands for "make directory" and "-p" stands for --parents, visa
> vi parent folders or directories*

To do: Add content for this page: "Creating Nix Packages"

Standard Environment
--------------------

Most packages build their software in the "standard environment". Read
the [Standard Environment wiki
documentation](//NixPkgs Standard Environment).
