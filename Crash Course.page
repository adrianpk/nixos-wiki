By the word *nix* you should understand a computer language and its
related toolkit interpreting that language. That computer language is
not meant to be used for general purpose computing like C or Java, but
it's meant for defining how packages and its dependencies have to be
built.

As most computer language interpreters, the *nix* interpreter has
specific inputs and outputs.

-   Inputs: nix source files, urls of files to be manipulated, command
    line arguments.
-   Outputs: files or directories in the *nix store*. They are named
    "output paths". A database also maintains the validity of each path
    (valid or not) and its dependencies on other paths.

===========================================================================================================

Here go all the outputs of the nix interpreters, and this is the only
way it is filled; all the files in the nix store are meant to be created
only as nix interpret results. And its content of "output paths" is
meant to be deleted only through special processes, namely "garbage
collection" or direct request for "deletion" through the *nix-store*
interpreter.

The store has a database of whether a store path is valid (properly
built by nix), and has a database of dependencies on other store paths.
It also has a consideration of "live" and "dead" paths. Only valid paths
can be live, live paths cannot be deleted, dependencies of live paths
are also live paths.

Whether a path is live or not is determined by reachability through
"gcroots" (Garbage Collector Roots). There is a directory of symlinks
containing the gcroots. If jumping through the symlinks any store path
can be reached, then it is considered live.

As the nix stored is filled and filled while we create output store
paths with nix, the nix user usually manually requests for "garbage
collection", and that means: remove all dead paths in the store.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Crash_Course&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: The stages building using nix")] The stages building using nix
===========================================================================================================================================

The nix language allows defining how to build a specific output store
path. For example, we can write in nix the rules to build a store path
as a simple text file containing the text "hello". And we can write the
nix expressions (users usually use this term) to build more complex
store paths, as for example a directory containing the installation
result of *xterm*. For both cases, we use the nix language to tell nix
end up calling a program with some arguments.

The first stage goes on interpreting the nix expressions (as with the
nix-instantiate program). That will create some special files in the
store called 'derivation builders', having the extension .drv. As the
nix language may define complex relationships, those files contain the
result of evaluations in terms of file names. These builders refer,
nevertheless, only to files in the nix store.

A second stage takes those .drv files, and 'builds' them (as with
nix-store --realise).

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Crash_Course&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Writing your own nix packages")] Writing your own nix packages
===========================================================================================================================================

If you want to share the expressions you are going to write, get a VCS
copy of nixpkgs and prepare patches that you will later send to the
nix-dev list.

If you want to package things for your own, you can write them as
packageOverrides in your nixpkgs config. You can have a nixpkgs config
(usually \~/.nixpkgs/config.nix) like this:

    {
       packageOverrides = pkgsÂ : with pkgs; {

         # If you want to debug linphone and its alsa libraries, let's keep the symbols and use -O0 for them:
         alsaLibDebug = pkgs.misc.debugVersion pkgs.alsaLib;
         linphoneDebug = pkgs.misc.debugVersion (pkgs.linphone.override {
           alsaLib = alsaLibDebug;
         });

         # A program you may want to be able to build
         # Due to the 'with pkgs;' above you can directly reference stdenv or readline.
         myPackage = stdenv.mkDerivation {
           name = "Mypackage-0.1";
           src = fetchurl {
             url = http://blabla.org/file.tar.gz;
             sha256 = "...";
           };
           # Use whatever nixpkgs attribute you want.
           buildInputs = [ readline ];
         };

         # Another program, this time with maybe a more complex expression
         # that you prefer to keep in a file apart.
         myOtherPackage = callPackage ./myotherpackage.nix {};

         # A derivation of a build environment that you may later 'source' in your bash
         # to build programs linked with alsa.
         alsaEnv = pkgs.myEnvFun {
             name = "alsa";
             buildInputs = [ stdenv alsaLib ];
         };
       }
    }
