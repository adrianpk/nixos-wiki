For various reasons some work has not been committed to the main trunk
repositories. You find a description about some of them here:

Haskell overlay
---------------

Let's you install nearly all hackage packages easily.
[hack-nix](/w/index.php?title=Http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hack-Nix&action=edit&redlink=1 "Http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hack-Nix (page does not exist)")
also provide a convinient way to setup multiple build environments for a
project
[haskell-nix-overlay](/w/index.php?title=Http://github.com/MarcWeber/haskell-nix-overlay&action=edit&redlink=1 "Http://github.com/MarcWeber/haskell-nix-overlay (page does not exist)")

Reasons for not committing it to trunk: The solver is quite low. There
are many updates.
