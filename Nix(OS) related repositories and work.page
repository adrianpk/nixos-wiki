For various reasons some work has not been committed to the main trunk
repositories. You find a description about some of them here:

Haskell overlay
---------------

Let's you install nearly all hackage packages easily.
[hack-nix](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hack-Nix) also provides a
convenient way to setup multiple build environments for a project
[haskell-nix-overlay](http://github.com/MarcWeber/haskell-nix-overlay)

Reasons for not committing it to trunk: The solver is quiteÂ ?low. There
are many updates.
