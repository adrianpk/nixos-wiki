WISH LIST
---------

What is missing on the wiki? even if you don't have time let others know
who may have time what you think is missing. Should we group this by
author? Should we add kind of rating?

This is a list containing random notes right now. Add items yourself
here.

random notes
------------

What policies do we have ? Eg "Nix" and "NixOS" is the spelling which
should be used everywhere. What about links? Should they all start with
an upper case letter? Anyway. Keep this short because everyone is
supposed to read it!
