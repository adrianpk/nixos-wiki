(viric) I think Side-by-side components are the way to go, so DLL are
not taken as \*strictly shared\* by Windows only based on the filename.
[This document section
3.3](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms995843.aspx) says that
this behaviour of sxs will only happen if the files are placed in the
named directory, or otherwise they will be taken as shared.

i've been experimenting with nix on windows and mingw as a new
toolchain:

two problems (discussed at the blog posting from above):

-   curl vs curl.exe seems to create problems (as cygwin sees both as
    the same program)
-   symlinks and dll files (PATH, missing LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH) is another

just don't forget to check it out!
