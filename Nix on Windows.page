(viric) I think Side-by-side components are the way to go, so DLL are
not taken as \*strictly shared\* by Windows only based on the filename.
[This document section
3.3](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms995843.aspx) says that
this behaviour of sxs will only happen if the files are placed in the
named directory, or otherwise they will be taken as shared.
