python basics
-------------

-   **\*.pth** files

Python supports \*.pth files which contain the paths to the parent
directories of your python modules one per line. Those files should be
placed in site-packages and can be called whatever you want them to
call.

-   PYTHONPATH

The other way is to set additional paths for python just before running
the externally kept modules. This is done by setting the python paths to
the environment variable PYTHONPATH. Note again that python paths point
not to the modules themselves, but to their parent directories!

-   PYTHONUSERBASE

?

in general see [6]

general python integration into nixos
-------------------------------------

### requirements

-   mix python 2.x and 3.x in the same profile

marcweber and qknight **vote against that**. it makes packaging
complicated: to mix python2 and python3? We could introduce
NIX\_PYTHON\_SITES\_2 and NIX\_PYTHON\_SITES\_3 or such.

-   pyLibA (python wrapper for a library) is used by pyLibB: nix
    expressions must be able to use either

### proposed nixos environment variables

-   NIX\_PYTHON\_SITES

qknight's problems
------------------

### packaging virt-manager

see **problem 2** in [5]

### python-gudev

i have problems packaging python-gudev:

     gudevmodule.c:19:23: fatal error: pygobject.h: No such file or directory

but looking at the exports (nix-env -i python-gudev -K; source env-vars)
i can see:

    -I/nix/store/lqsihhkhl7rhr18x7qiviihyp2byc5gw-pygobject-2.27.0/include

but in that folder there is only pygtk-2.0 folder:

     ls -la /nix/store/lqsihhkhl7rhr18x7qiviihyp2byc5gw-pygobject-2.27.0/include
     pygtk-2.0/

so in that folder i find:

     ls -la /nix/store/lqsihhkhl7rhr18x7qiviihyp2byc5gw-pygobject-2.27.0/include/pygtk-2.0/
     pyglib.h  pygobject.h

### the problem

as discussed in [1] and quoting [2]

       # All python code is installed into a "gtk-2.0" sub-directory. That
       # sub-directory may be useful on systems which share several library
       # versions in the same prefix, i.e. /usr/local, but on Nix that directory
       # is useless. Furthermore, its existence makes it very hard to guess a
       # proper $PYTHONPATH that allows "import gtk" to succeed.

show how should i package python-gudev then? the source for python-gudev
(which produces the above error) can be found at [4]
