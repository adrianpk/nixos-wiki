general python integration into nixos
-------------------------------------

### requirements

-   mix python 2.x and 3.x in the same profile
-   pyLibA (python wrapper for a library) is used by pyLibB: nix
    expressions must be able to use either

### environment variables

-   PYTHONPATH
-   PYTHONUSERBASE
-   NIX\_PYTHON\_SITES

qknight's problems
------------------

i have problems packaging python-gudev:

     gudevmodule.c:19:23: fatal error: pygobject.h: No such file or directory

but looking at the exports (nix-env -i python-gudev -K; source env-vars)
i can see:

    -I/nix/store/lqsihhkhl7rhr18x7qiviihyp2byc5gw-pygobject-2.27.0/include

but in that folder there is only pygtk-2.0 folder:

     ls -la /nix/store/lqsihhkhl7rhr18x7qiviihyp2byc5gw-pygobject-2.27.0/include
     pygtk-2.0/

so in that folder i find:

     ls -la /nix/store/lqsihhkhl7rhr18x7qiviihyp2byc5gw-pygobject-2.27.0/include/pygtk-2.0/
     pyglib.h  pygobject.h

### the problem

as discussed in [1] and quoting [2]

       # All python code is installed into a "gtk-2.0" sub-directory. That
       # sub-directory may be useful on systems which share several library
       # versions in the same prefix, i.e. /usr/local, but on Nix that directory
       # is useless. Furthermore, its existence makes it very hard to guess a
       # proper $PYTHONPATH that allows "import gtk" to succeed.

show how should i package python-gudev then? the source for python-gudev
(which produces the above error) can be found at [4]
