Vimprobable
===========

Vimprobable is a web browser that behaves like the [Vimperator
plugin](http://www.vimperator.org/) available for Mozilla Firefox. It is
based on the WebKit engine (using GTK bindings). The goal of Vimprobable
is to build a completely keyboard-driven, efficient and pleasurable
browsing-experience. Its featureset might be considered "minimalistic",
but not as minimalistic as being completely featureless.

Vimprobable is available in two versions, that is vimprobable and
vimprobable2. In case you don't already know what you want you should
follow the instructions below and install vimprobable2. For more
information see the [official
homepage](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/vimprobable/).

**Note:** This article covers the installation of vimprobable2
exclusively. However, unless otherwise noted you can apply the same
procedure to installing vimprobable by just replacing the occurences of
vimprobable2 accordingly.

Installation
------------

    nix-env -i vimprobable2

Usage
-----

### tabbed

Neither vimprobable nor vimprobable2 offer tab support. However, you can
use [tabbed](http://tools.suckless.org/tabbed) for that. Install tabbed
and create an alias to vimprobable2 as following.

    nix-env -i 

    alias vimprobable2="vimprobable2 -e \"\$(tabbed -d)\""

You can switch tabs by pressing \`gt' or \`gT'.
