Vimprobable
===========

Vimprobable is a web browser that behaves like the [Vimperator
plugin](http://www.vimperator.org/) available for Mozilla Firefox. It is
based on the WebKit engine (using GTK bindings). The goal of Vimprobable
is to build a completely keyboard-driven, efficient and pleasurable
browsing-experience. Its featureset might be considered "minimalistic",
but not as minimalistic as being completely featureless.

Vimprobable is available in two versions, that is vimprobable and
vimprobable2. As of now only vimprobable2 is available.

Installation
------------

    $ nix-env -i vimprobable2

Configuration
-------------

While vimprobable2 offers some configuration through the vimprobablerc
file some configuration can solely be done in config.h before
compilation. However, some of config.h's configuration options are made
available to Nix making it easy to configure vimprobable without having
to touch config.h.

### Search engines

You can override the default search engines using Nix.

[Describe how you do this.]

By default vimprobable offers the following search engines.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Search engine
  Shortcut
  ------------------------------------ ------------------------------------
  Google                               Wikipedia
  g                                    w
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use search engine shortcuts for a URL in vimprobable. For
example to search for \`NixOS' in Google open the following URL.

    g NixOS

You can define a default search engine which lets you omit the shortcut
for this search engine by setting \`defaultsearch' in the vimprobablerc
file.

    $ mkdir -p $HOME/.config/vimprobable
    $ echo "defaultsearch=g" >> $HOME/.config/vimprobable/vimprobablerc

This setting makes Google the default search engine.

### tabbed

vimprobable doesn't offer tab support. However, you can use
[tabbed](http://tools.suckless.org/tabbed) for that. Install tabbed and
create an alias to vimprobable2 as following.

    $ nix-env -i tabbed

    $ alias vimprobable2="vimprobable2 -e \"\$(tabbed -d)\""

You can switch tabs by pressing \`gt' or \`gT'.
