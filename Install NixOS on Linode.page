-   1\) Select "Deploy a Distribution" from the linode dashboard
    [[1]](https://www.linode.com/members/linode/dashboard.cfm), and select
    Distribution "Debian 5.0 64bit" (the smallest disk requirement),
    Deployment Disk Size 384MB, Swap Disk the size you want for your final
    NixOS swap space (this volume can be shared as only one OS will be
    booted at a time).\
    \
    This Debian 5.0 image be used to bootstrap NixOS, and also as a rescue
    medium in the future. Note that you can not use "Finnix" if you want to
    use NixOS x86\_64, as linode does't support finnix64, so you can't run
    64-bit NixOS binaries from Finnix. And we can't think of any reason
    you'd want to use NixOS i686 on a VPS.

-   2\) Create a disk image (partition) for NixOS to be installed on to via
    the linode dashboard
    [[2]](https://www.linode.com/members/linode/dashboard.cfm) "Create a new
    Disk Image" option.

-   3\) Edit the "My Debian 5.0 64bit Profile" to have your NixOS disk be
    xvdc, and save the profile

-   4\) boot into "My Debian 5.0 64bit Profile", connect to it via linshell,
    and mount xvdc

-   5\) The x86\_64 bootstrap archive can be downloaded from\

    <http://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixos/trunk/minimal_install_archive/latest-for/x86_64-linux/download/1/nixos-install-archive.tar.bz2>

-   6\) install following the archive installation README, which is named
    "README-BOOTSTRAP-NIXOS". Force creating a init script and get
    networking options from the configuration profile editing page:

<!-- -->

     boot.loader.initScript.enable = true;
     
     networking = {
       useDHCP = true;
     };

-   7\) Create a configuration profile assigning your NixOS disk image to
    /dev/xvda (/sbin/init will be started). Choose a kernel, and also assign
    swapspace as xvdb.

-   8\) Reboot. Have fun.
