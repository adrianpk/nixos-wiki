-   create disk images (partitions) for NixOS to be installed on to via
    the linode dashboard
    [[1]](https://www.linode.com/members/linode/dashboard.cfm) "Create a
    new Disk Image" option.
-   create a configuration profile starting their Finnix rescue system
    [[2]](http://www.linode.com/wiki/index.php/Finnix_LiveCD_Recovery_Distribution#Setting_it_up)
    -   select Finnix Kernel, iso image as /dev/xvda, Finnix initrd,
        your disk image as /dev/xvdb
-   create a configuration profile assigning your disk image to
    /dev/xvda (/sbin/init will be started), choose a kernel.
-   boot into Finnix, connect to linshell, mount xvdb
-   install following the archive installation README. Force creating a
    init script and get networking options from the configuration
    profile editing page:

<!-- -->

     boot.loader.initScript.enable = true;
     
     networking = {
       useDHCP = false;
       interfaces = [ { ipAddress = "XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"Â ; name = "eth0";
                        subnetMask = "255.255.255.0"; } ];
       defaultGateway = "YYY.YYY.YYY.YYY";
     };

-   Reboot. Have fun.

The bootstrap archives can be downloaded by visiting
<http://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/nixos/trunk/minimal_install_archive> and
then clicking on an okay build number, which will take you to a URL like
<http://hydra.nixos.org/build/475780> - then click on "File
nixos-install-archive.tar.bz2 of type tarball", which will start
download of a file with a URL like
<http://hydra.nixos.org/build/475780/download/1/nixos-install-archive.tar.bz2>
(don't actually use the build 475780 URLs oh - they are likely to be
very old by the time you read this).
