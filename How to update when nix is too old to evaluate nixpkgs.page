### How to update when nix is too old to evaluate nixpkgs

This situation can happen if you don't update nix for longer time, so
new features of nix are already used in nixpkgs, preventing you to
evaluate it. Currently it's typical for 1.5.x -\> 1.6.x transition, I
think.

You only need to acquire a newer version of nix to continue. The easiest
way is (probably) to just fetch the binaries from Hydra, which can be
done *without* evaluation of nixpkgs.

Just go to
<http://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixos/trunk-combined/nixpkgs.nix.x86_64-linux/latest-finished>
and perform a one-click install (substitute your platform name if it's
different). Description of that is directly on the Hydra page.
