The latest version of NixPkgs may use features which are not available
in our version of Nix. The result of this is being unable to install or
reference packages from NixPkgs. For example, the current NixPkgs uses
features of Nix 1.6, but we may only have Nix 1.5. To resolve this
situation, we must acquire a newer version of Nix.

To upgrade Nix, we must obtain the newer version's binaries. There are
two easy ways to do this, both of which fetch the binaries directly from
the Nix project's build server. This method doesn't require evaluating
NixPkgs, so it works great for upgrading the Nix program, itself.

If we have a browser installed on the target platform, we can open the
[Nix -
Latest](http://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixos/trunk-combined/nixpkgs.nix.x86_64-linux/latest-finished)
page, hosted by the Nix project's build server, and click the "One-click
Install" link. This links to a file having a `.nixpkg` file extension,
which should be set up to be handled by the `nix-install-package`
program. Note: Substitute the platform name if your platform is not
x86\_64.

#### [[edit](/w/index.php?title=How_to_update_when_nix_is_too_old_to_evaluate_nixpkgs&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Installing via Command Line")] Installing via Command Line

If the platform doesn't have a browser installed, which is a common case
for servers, we can directly use the `nix-install-package` program.

First, we need to find the URL of the latest binaries. To do that, we
must open the [Nix -
Latest](http://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixos/trunk-combined/nixpkgs.nix.x86_64-linux/latest-finished)
page, then copy the URL of the "One-click Install" link.

Using the URL we just obtained, paste it into the following command to
install the latest version of the Nix program directly from the Nix
project's build server.

     $ nix-install-package --non-interactive --url $NIX_LATEST_URL

##### [[edit](/w/index.php?title=How_to_update_when_nix_is_too_old_to_evaluate_nixpkgs&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Trusted Binary Caches")] Trusted Binary Caches

The recommended method for upgrading Nix is by using the
`nix-install-package` program. This program uses the "nix.conf" file to
verify that the URL is included in the "trusted\_binary\_caches".
Running `nix-install-package` as root is not constrained in this manner,
but it will only install the specified package for the root user, rather
than for our normal user account.

Therefore, if our installation is rejected due to being hosted by an
untrusted host, we must add the hostname to the "nix.conf" file. For
NixOS useres, add the hostname to the `nix.trustedBinaryCaches`
configuration option and rebuild the machine. For users of other OSs,
manually edit the "nix.conf" file, usually found in the `/etc/nix/`
directory.
