### Installation

There are two steps to installing fonts globally on NixOS - building the
font, and registering it with Fontconfig so that applications can
discover it. The `configuration.nix` snippet below installs and
registers a single font, "inconsolata".

     {
       environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
         inconsolata
       ];
     
       fonts.fonts = [ pkgs.inconsolata ];
     }

### Debugging

The global Fontconfig configuration is kept in `/etc/fonts/fonts.conf`.

but it can be useful to see what is actually written there.
