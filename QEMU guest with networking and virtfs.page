Introduction
------------

This article describes how to run a QEMU guest with full networking and
VirtFS support. VirtFS (Plan 9 folder sharing over Virtio - I/O
virtualization framework)

    allows you to mount folders from the host system on the guest system, this is significantly faster than folder sharing over the network e.g. NFS.

Prepare a host image
--------------------

    qemu-img create -f qcow2 /mnt/OSImages/my_os.qcow2 5G

Alternatively you may want to download a preinstalled QEMU image e.g.
Debian images: <http://people.debian.org/~aurel32/qemu/>
