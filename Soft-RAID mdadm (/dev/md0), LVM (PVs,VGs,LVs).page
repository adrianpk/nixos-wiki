what is this
------------

this short guide helps to create a suitable setup to have LVM on top of
a mdadm soft raid. a closely related article is
[Encrypted\_Root\_on\_NixOS](//Encrypted Root on NixOS)

how does it work
----------------

it is possible (at least in the virtualbox virtual machine i installed
to verify it) to boot from a boot LV which is located on top of a mdadm
soft raid.

i was using: **nixos-minimal-0.1pre27077-x86\_64-linux.iso**

this chain of commands illustrates that:

     mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1
     
     pvcreate /dev/md0
     vgcreate myvolgrp /dev/md0
     lvcreate -L 1G -n boot myvolgrp
     lvcreate -L 5G -n system myvolgrp
     
     mkfs.ext4 -n boot /dev/myvolgrp/boot
     mkfs.ext4 -n system /dev/myvolgrp/system
     
     mount -L system /mnt
     nixos-option --install
     
     vi /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
     ...
       { mountPoint = "/";
         label="system";
       }
       { mountPoint = "/boot";
         label="boot";
       }
     
     
     nixos-install
     reboot

this implies that:

-   you don't need a /dev/sda1 boot partition anymore
-   you can boot from a mdadm device BUT
-   you can also boot from a LVM on top of a mdadm device

**note:** still consider turning of the disk caches when using
soft-raids
