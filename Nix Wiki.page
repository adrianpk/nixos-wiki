A wiki is a low-barrier way to build a database of eventually consistent
and correct info. Good topics includes history, design, and purpose of
Nix, as well as relationships with non-Nix topics.

A wiki is a scratch-pad owned by the community. If it's missing
something, add it somewhere. People monitor changes to the wiki and will
eventually modify the additions to fit the design of the rest of the
wiki.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nix_Wiki&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Topics")] Topics
=========================================================================================

The Nix project consists of efforts which span several areas, so we
visually organize the wiki around them. These areas include

-   OS-management
-   Software building & Distribution
-   Development environments

Contrary to what the Nix project's domain name may suggest, NixOS is
only one component of the Nix project. This wiki is not only for
NixOS-related topics, nor is it only for developers to add sparse
documentation and notes, though both are welcome. Rather, the Nix wiki
should be a place for ideas, which include describing the big picture
and explaining details.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nix_Wiki&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Writing Style")] Writing Style
=======================================================================================================

If you care about Writing style, here is a quick list:

-   First-person
-   (Research and add more)

The [UDX Initiative](//UDX Initiative) page has explanations of the
guidelines we try to follow.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nix_Wiki&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Terms")] Terms
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using terms consistently helps readers make correct connections between
topics. When deciding between multiple, technically correct terms to
use, prefer the ones in this list. Also, consistent casing is as
important as consistent terms.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nix_Wiki&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Wiki Software")] Wiki Software
=======================================================================================================

from the wiki's purpose of a \*central\* place for community-maintained
big-picture info.

As mentioned above, a wiki's purpose is to be a central place for
community-maintained, big-picture info, with a low barrier for receiving
contributions. What kind of software can we use to manage this? Here's a
list of features which enables this kind of information compilation.

Requirements:

1.  Easy for anyone to contribute
2.  Searchable
3.  Content history, to recover lost info

Nice to have:

1.  Organizable into topics
2.  Easy to maintain software
3.  Portable storage format

 Currently, we use MediaWiki software to edit, style, store, and serve
the content, and it works pretty well. We are, of course, willing to
discuss alternatives.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nix_Wiki&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Other")] Other
=======================================================================================

For now, our wiki guidelines will fall-back to those described on the
[Arch wiki
help](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ArchWiki:Contributing) page,
as they seem to have experience.

[jacobian.org](http://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/) is
another page. It has very good suggestions for documentation.
