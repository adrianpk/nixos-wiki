[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Keymap&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Changing your X keymap")] Changing your X keymap
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In your *configuration.nix* set the layout and the variant you want to
use. If you want to use Programmer's Dvorak then you would use the
**us** layout with **dvp** variety:

    services.xserver.layout = "us";
    services.xserver.xkbVariant = "dvp";

This follows the regular **setxkbmap** syntax. Rebuild and restart X.
You can use setxkbmap for temporary solution.

If you're using a desktop environment such as KDE, you can probably use
that to set your keymap but you'll have problems if you ever stop using
that particular desktop environment.

### [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Keymap&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Compose key")] Compose key

Use '**xkbOptions'**:

    services.xserver.xkbOptions = "compose:caps";

The above would override the Caps-Lock key with Compose key behaviour.

As usual, remember that you can use **nixos-option services.xserver** to
check available options as well as **man configuration.nix**.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Keymap&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Changing your virtual console keymap")] Changing your virtual console keymap
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you don't boot straight into a graphical session, the chances are
you'll want to change your keymap and possibly locale. You can do this
with **i18n** block in your *configuration.nix*. The **kbd** package
provides many keymaps for you to use

    i18n = {
      consoleKeyMap = "dvorak;
      defaultLocale = "en_US.UTF-8";
    };

Notably, **consoleKeyMap** can point to a file but you have to make sure
it's available early on in the boot process (so don't put it on a
network share you mount later). I point mine to a keymap in my home
directory as it is not provided by **kbd** package.

    consoleKeyMap = "/home/shana/keymaps/dvp-1_2_1.map.gz";

The syntax is the same as the one accepted by **loadkeys** command (from
**kbd** package)
