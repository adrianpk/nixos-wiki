The Nix package manager installs, updates, and removes Nix-packaged apps
and libraries. Nix is unique among package managers in that software
installed by Nix is read-only, which ensures that a Nix package's
dependencies will not change when upgrading or removing other packages.
As a result of this design, the Nix package manager has several
desirable side-effects, including atomic package upgrades/rollbacks and
complete dependency graphs for every package. The [About
Nix](http://nixos.org/nix/manual/#idp24368448) chapter of the Nix manual
has more information.

This page was created by the Nix community to help others understand and
use the Nix package manager. Please help by adding pages for missing
topics and updating information in existing pages.
