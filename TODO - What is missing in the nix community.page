On the nix-dev mailinglist free-nix was announced [1] - a fork of Nix.
Now the community is about finding out what exactly needs to be done and
why a fork would be required.

-   social contracts such as this
    <http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines>
-   option to enable "free" packages only (eg not flash). "free" usually
    means open source as defined by open source software foundation or
    the like

Let's keep in mind that nixos is young - and that there may be slightly
different use cases (mobile phones) in the future. Thus policies may
become outdated, too. For that reason we should only as much time on
policies as necessary. There are many open question - and different
styles - maybe its too early to settle on too many policies - but who
knows? I feel its important that we can still "turn around" and change
the direction - Marc Weber
