Tramp
-----

Tramp needs to call \`ls\` and \`id\` but it will not find them on a
NixOS machine without additional configuration because they are not in
the usual places. To fix this you can add the following to your
\~/.emacs

    (require 'tramp) 
    (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path "/var/run/current-system/sw/bin")

You can then edit local files as root e.g.

    C-x C-f /su::/etc/nixos/configuration.nix

To login to a remote NixOS machine which uses port 1234 for ssh:

    C-x C-f /ssh:username@hostname#1234:/

Enable Nix mode
---------------

    (load-library "nix-mode")
