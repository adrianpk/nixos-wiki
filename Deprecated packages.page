Qt3/KDE3
--------

Qt 3.x and KDE 3.x are not supported by Nokia and KDE team. Most
packages migrated to KDE 4.x. If we cannot avoid using qt-3.x and/or
kde-3.x, look at [trinity project](http://www.trinitydesktop.org/).

qcad

librecad

(viric) I've it half packaged.

taskjuggler

(viric) The gui can be disabled in the build.

twinkle

(viric) I want it. That's the SIP program that worked best for me.
([7c6f434c](/w/index.php?title=User:7c6f434c&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:7c6f434c (page does not exist)"))
I also want it.. It has the sanest just-IP mode of everything I tried.
(urkud) probably, qt3 will stay just for twinkle...

qucs

(viric) They released on 12/2011, and look like keeping with qt3. I
don't use it but I prefer it to stay. (urkud) They have qucs-qt4 branch.
Didn't checked whether it works.

games/six

(falsifian) I use this sometimes; it's the only Linux program for
playing the board game Hex that I know of. Certainly not a critical
package though.
