Getting ALSA to work
--------------------

-   on a console fire up alsamixer

<!-- -->

     alsamixer

-   you see plenty of vertical bars?
    -   you should be okay

-   you see very few vertical bars and the sound card (top-left) is
    something like "PC Speaker"?
    -   hit the 'S' key, you should be able to switch to the "real"
        audio card (if not your audio card is likely to not being
        supported yet).
    -   when the real audio card is selected you should be viewing the
        "plenty vertical bars" thing.
        -   first thing to do is to disable pc speaker (kernel module
            "snd-pcsp", see below.

### Make your audio card the default ALSA card

Sometimes the pc-speaker is the default audio card for ALSA. You can
make your real sound card default instead. For example, if your sound
card is "hda-intel" then add

      boot.extraModprobeConfig = ''
        options snd slots=snd-hda-intel
      '';

to your /etc/nixos/configuration.nix.

Alternatively you can ...

### Disable PC Speaker "audio card"

edit /etc/nixos/configuration.nix and add "snd\_pcsp" to
boot.blacklistedKernelModules option:

     boot.blacklistedKernelModules = [ "snd_pcsp" ];

Now reboot and retry from the beginning (i.e. check that your real card
is shown by alsamixer without using the 'S' key).

### Fixing sound in KDE

(alsamixer shows my audio card by default, but i get no sound in KDE)

-   be sure to explicitly install pkgs.kde44.phonon in
    /etc/nixos/configuration.nix (environment.kdePackages option) or via
    nix-env -i

After this step you should be seeing xine and gstreamer backends in the
systemsettings / Computer Administration / Multimedia 's Backends tab.

-   If you still see Pulseaudio as the only option in the main tab of
    systemsettings / Computer Administration / Multimedia, do the
    following:

<!-- -->

     $ rm -rf ~/.pulse/*
     $ killall5 -9 pulseaudio

-   Log out of kde and re-login

Now you should be able to select your audio card, default hw0,0 etc as
your audio device in systemsettings / Computer Administration /
Multimedia

Test the audio and enjoy the relaxing KDE's arpeggio.

### Making PulseAudio work for most of apps

This routes default ALSA sound streams via PulseAudio

-   Install alsa-plugins(pkgs.alsaPlugins)
-   Put this into \~/.asoundrc:

<!-- -->

     pcm.pulse {                                                                                              
       type pulse                                                                                               
       }                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                
       ctl.pulse {                                                                                              
       type pulse                                                                                               
       }                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                
       pcm.!default {                                                                                           
       type pulse                                                                                               
       }                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                
       ctl.!default {                                                                                           
       type pulse                                                                                               
       }            

You can check if everything works by using pavucontrol to see the audio
streams and make sure PulseAudio detects your audio hardware.

You may need to add your users to the audio group:

    $usermod -a -G audio myusername

If a user is not a member the audio group only a dummy device will
appear in pavucontrol.
