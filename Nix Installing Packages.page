How to install a Nix package?
=============================

If we want to install software using Nix, we need a Nix expression for
it.

What is a Nix expression?
-------------------------

A Nix expression has all information required to build a piece of
software. Generally, this means a link to the software's source code, a
list of other software required to build and/or run it, and a scripts of
shell commands required to compile its source code and install its
binaries.

When a Nix expression is evaluated, Nix will use the software's SHA hash
to find its pre-compiled binaries by searching for it in all binary
caches registered with the Nix installation. If it isn't found, Nix will
create the software's binaries by building them from source code, then
installing them into the appropriate directory structure. Once complete,
Nix will copy this resulting structure into the read-only Nix Store,
which ensures it can be used as a reliable dependency for other software
packages. This entry in the Nix Store created by a Nix expression is
called a "derivation". Finally, Nix will add a link to this derivation
to our environment, which makes it visible on the command line for us to
use.

Where can I get Nix expressions?
--------------------------------

Writing a Nix expression can be quite a challenge. Luckily, many other
people have shared their expressions by adding them to a central list,
named NixPkgs, available on the [NixPkgs GitHub
repository](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/). If you installed Nix,
you can register the NixPkgs repository by using the `nix-channel`
