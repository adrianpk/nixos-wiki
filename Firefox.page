This wiki page contains information about using the Java plugin in
Firefox on NixOS.

From Firefox version 3.6, the old Java plugin located in
\<JRE\>/plugin/i386/javaplugin-oji.so no longer works (source:
[[1]](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/manual-plugin-install-linux-136395.html)).
The new plugin is located in \<JRE\>/lib/i386/libnpjp2.so.

For Firefox to reach the plugins, there are 3 ways:

1.  put the path of the plugin in the environment variable
    MOZ\_PLUGIN\_PATH
2.  create a symbolic link to the plugin in \~/.mozilla/plugins
3.  create a symbolic link to the plugin in
    \<FIREFOX-DIRECTORY\>/plugins

Help to do each method:

1.  The MOZ\_PLUGIN\_PATH way is implemented in NixOS (look at
    /etc/nixos/nixpkgs/pkgs/development/compilers/jdk/jdk6-linux.nix)
    but the path given there is the path to the old plugin whcih does
    not work. You can correct this by changing the ***if installjdk then
    "/jre/plugin/i386/ns7" else "/plugin/i386/ns7";*** line to ***if
    installjdk then "/jre/lib/i386" else "/lib/i386";'***. This works
    but you will see a lot of warnings in the command line when running
    Firefox because it tries to load all the libraries in
    \<JRE\>/lib/i386 as a plugin. You should also install firefoxWrapper
    (or firefox-3.6.8-with-plugins if you are using nix-env) instead of
    firefox and set nixpkgs.config.firefox.jre = true in your
    /etc/nixos/configuration.nix.
2.  This is an easy way but you should do the same for all users:
    ***mkdir -p \~/.mozilla/plugins; ls -l \`which java\` | sed
    's/.\*-\> \\(.\*\\)\\/bin\\/java/ln -s
    \\1\\/lib\\/i386\\/libnpjp2.so \~\\/.mozilla\\/plugins/' | bash***
3.  The best would be to implement this centrally in
    /etc/nixos/nixpkgs/pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix and reach all the
    firefox plugins this way.
