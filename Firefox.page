To use plugins in firefox you need to install the "firefox-with-plugins"
package. The plugins are picked on installation according to your
`~/.nixpkgs/config.nix`. Example:

    {
      firefox = {
        jre = true;
        enableAdobeFlash = true;
        enablegoogletalkplugin = true;
      };
    }

 In case of JRE you need to perform some manual download to comply with
its license (Oracle JRE is used, currently). These steps are described
in the output when you try to install Firefox.

For a more complete and up-to-date list of plugins see the "wrapFirefox"
function in
