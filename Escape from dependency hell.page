changing package versions transitively
--------------------------------------

You want a package which requires a more recent version of gtkLibs? You
can't just pass a newer gtkLib version because your package depends on
other packages which also depend on gtkLibs? Use pkgsFunDeepOverride to
replace a package (eg selecting a newer version) within the dependency
graph: [mailinglist

I'm sure we'll hit cases where this doesn't help either without further
adjustments. But for now it does.
