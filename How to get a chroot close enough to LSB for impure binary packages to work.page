One of the options is special-chroot script by Michael Raskin.

Checkout configurations/ tree from Nix SVN repository. The exact
directory is
<https://nixos.org/repos/nix/configurations/trunk/misc/raskin/misc-scripts>
- the file is special-chroot. It expects to be run on NixOS, although I
have used it on non-NixOS Nix installations.

It has the following parameters:

1\) Root path where to prepare all the stuff 2) Home path as seen after
chroot 3) User name 4) *or 'usr-only' : if usr-only, /bin /sbin /lib are
skipped* 5) *or path : what to use instead of
/var/run/current-system/sw*

Tries to make most installers safe by mounting most things ro. /old-root
is mounted as rw, though.

Tries to unmount everything on termination.
