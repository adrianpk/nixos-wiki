work on in particular. Try to include some detail if the topic requires
an introduction for others, pointers to mailing list discussions,
tickets etc. could also be helpful. We don't all have to work on the
same thing, but it is good to take advantage of having people around to
flesh things out.

Improve python support
----------------------

Work on solving some of the following issues

-   Python package impurity (stop packages from trying to install
    dependencies)
-   Run the package tests (currently most of them are disabled because
    they don't work)
-   Write nix tests which test that the python modules work (to some
    degree)
-   Look at generating nix expressions from pypi (see MarcWeber's work
    on this)

-   <https://github.com/garbas/python2nix>
-   <https://github.com/chaoflow/nixpkgs> (python branch)
-   <https://gitorious.org/nixpkgs-python-overlay>

Known issues:

-   Overzealous wrapPythonPrograms, also wraps included modules (just
    use wrapProgram?)

Considerations:

-   Should we use distribute as the basis for installing python
    packages?

Tasks

-   Merging of python fork
-   Documents: Improve Section 5.2 on
    <http://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixpkgs/trunk/tarball/latest/download-by-type/doc/manual#id541167>
    to provide an example of a good package
-   Easy to use python environment, e.g. for Plone
-   Python purity
-   Problematic python packages: numpy, mathplotlib etc. :
    <https://github.com/chaoflow/nixpkgs/issues/2>
-   Consider how to generate nix expressions for python package (see
    garbas' repo)
