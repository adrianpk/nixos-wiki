Mercurial and nixos/nixpkgs
---------------------------

You are less than 30 years old and really can't get into non-distributed
VCS? Then this page might be what you're looking for!

### Installing Mercurial and hgsubversion

     nix-env -i mercurial

     nix-env -i hgsubversion

(hgsubversion will be hopefully soon available via nix...)

### Configuring Mercurial to use hgsubversion

-   EDIT \~/.hgrc

<!-- -->

     [ui]
     username = Firstname Lastname <email>
     verbose = True

     [extensions]
     hgext.convert=
     rebase=
     svn=~/.nix-profile/lib/python2.6/hgsubversion

-   SAVE and QUIT (only the extensions part is important here)
-   check that everuthing is ok:

<!-- -->

     $ hg version --svn

     hgsubversion: 1.1.2+101-bfb88a304ebe
     Subversion: 1.6.12
     bindings: Subvertpy 0.7.4

### Cloning the nixpkgs svn repository

This \*WILL\* take a \*LONG\* time (about 10-20 minutes)

     $ mkdir -p ~/some/path/
     $ cd ~/some/path
     $ hg clone https://svn.nixos.org/repos/nix/nixpkgs/trunk nixpkgs-hg

-   Once done you \*MUST\* ensure that all file permissions are the same
    as in /etc/nixos/nixpkgs (mercurial will apply commits from the
    beginning of the history to the latest revision to rebuild the tree,
    "forgetting" about file permissions in the way).
-   Failing to do so will result in your tree producing derivations with
    different hashes than the official nixpkgs/trunk (and by consequence
    the inability to use binaries built by hydra, i.e. you'll need to
    re-bootstrap your nixos entierely). Worst the inability to bootstrap
    the system, as the files in question should really have the
    executable flag activated (see below).
-   In my case the only files with wrong permissions were those
    executable needed for bootstrapping the system, very bad.
-   Make sure that at least those files have these permissions (notice
    the executable flag).

### Staying up to date

     $ hg pull

### Diffs between svn and your version

     $ hg diff --svn -r<hg LOCAL revision>

(will show the svn revision of modified files)

### Commit to svn (not tested!)

     $ hg push
