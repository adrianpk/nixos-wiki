What are the builder-accessible pieces of information that can lead to
repeated build producing bit-for-bit different outputs?

### System time

Additional problem: ctime on files, if build creates any archives

#### Ways to fix the problem

##### LD\_PRELOAD

Works only for dynamically-linked programs

##### ptrace

Slower?

### System CPU model/features

### Order of directory entries

ls -u giving different order may lead to things like jars being not
bit-for-bit identical

### Deliberate randomness

Example: package generating a andom seed during build. It is a problem
from many points of view.

==Allegedely fixed (at least in Nix on NixOS)

### Builder PIDs
