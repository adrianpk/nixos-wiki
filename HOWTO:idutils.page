    # create database:
    mkid

    # use the database maybe this way
    lid -R grep -r 'your regex'

    # too much to type? put into your .bashrc then use: mylid 'your regex'
    mylid(){ lid -R grep -r "$1"; }

This is useful to find options in nixos (eg grep for mkOption) or find
packages in nixpkgs. You may also use this to find names in source code
(-\> see note). For code navigation there may be more accurate tools
such as ctags or csope etc.

note: you may have to use a custom config. idutils only index files it
knows about. Nixpkgs contains a patch which adds .nix files to the
global config file. AFAIK README files etc are skipped by default. So if
you don't find what you're looking for you still may want to use plain
grep.

If you want to search for "foo bar" you can still use a pipe:

    lid -R grep -r 'foo' | grep 'foo bar'
