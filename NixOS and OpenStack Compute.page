NixOS has some work-in-progress support for running [OpenStack
Compute](http://openstack.org/projects/compute/) (also known as
**Nova**), an infrastructure-as-a-service cloud computing platform. It's
currently limited to running all of Nova on a single machine, so it's
mostly useful for experimentation.

Enabling Nova
-------------

Add the following to your `configuration.nix`:

    virtualisation.nova.enableSingleNode = true;

and run `nixos-rebuild switch`. This will enable several daemons:

-   `nova-api` is the API server that receives and executes requests
    from cloud users, e.g. to start, query or terminate virtual
    machines.
-   `nova-objectstore` is a simple disk image server. It serves images
    placed in `/var/lib/nova/images/`.
-   `nova-scheduler` schedules VM execution requests and hands them over
    to a `nova-compute` node.
-   `nova-network` manages networks and allocates IP addresses.
-   `nova-compute` starts and manages virtual machines. It downloads
    disk images from `nova-objectstore`.
-   `libvirtd` is the low-level daemon responsible for running and
    managing virtual machines.
-   `rabbitmq` is a messaging protocol used by the various Nova
    components to communicate with each other.
