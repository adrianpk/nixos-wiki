Installing NixOS On VirtualBox
------------------------------

Using NixOS with VirtualBox on OS X.

-   Download the NixOs iso for 32 bit from <http://nixos.org>
-   Add a New Machine in VirtualBox with OS Type "Ubuntu"
-   Base Memory Size: 768 MB (or more)
-   New Hard Disk of 8 GB
-   Mount the CD-Rom with the NixOs iso (by clicking on CD/DVD-ROM)
-   Click on Settings / Advanced and enable PAE/NX
-   Networking: select "Attached to: NAT". Change host-interface to
    "en1: Airport".
-   Now you can install nix using the nixos manual:

     $ fdisk /dev/sda (create a full partition, don't skip this step)
     $ mke2fs -j -L nixos /dev/sda1 (idem)
     $ mount LABEL=nixos /mnt
     $ mkdir -p /mnt/etc/nixos
     $ nixos-hardware-scan > /mnt/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
     $ nano /mnt/etc/nixos/configuration.nix

(add the fileSystems. this is what my final config looks like:)

     {pkgs, ...}:
     {
       boot.initrd.extraKernelModules = [  "ata_piix" ];
       boot.kernelModules = [  ];
       boot.grubDevice = "/dev/sda";
       fileSystems = [
         { mountPoint = "/";
           label = "nixos";
         }
       ];
       nix.maxJobs = 1;
       services = {
         sshd = { enable = true; };
         xserver.videoDriver = "virtualbox";
       };
       environment.kdePackages = [
         pkgs.kernelPackages.virtualboxGuestAdditions
       ];
     }

Now we're ready to install!

     $ nixos-install
     $ reboot

Now you got a working nixos system. However, you can't conveniently log
in to ssh this way, so you'll need to set up port-forwarding. Doing that
is explained on this site, all you have to do is create a script named
"vbox-tunnel" that contains the following lines:

     #!/bin/bash
     cd /Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/MacOS/
     ./VBoxManage setextradata "$1" "VBoxInternal/Devices/pcnet/0/LUN#0/Config/$2/Protocol" TCP
     ./VBoxManage setextradata "$1" "VBoxInternal/Devices/pcnet/0/LUN#0/Config/$2/GuestPort" $3
     ./VBoxManage setextradata "$1" "VBoxInternal/Devices/pcnet/0/LUN#0/Config/$2/HostPort" $4

Now execute the script:

     vbox-tunnel Nix sshtunnel 22 2222

You should be able to log in to Nix now by running
`ssh -p2222 localhost` in your OS X Terminal. Enjoy!
