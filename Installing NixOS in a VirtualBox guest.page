This pages describes how to install NixOS in a VirtualBox guest.

-   Download a NixOS ISO from <http://nixos.org/releases/nixos/>
-   Add a New Machine in VirtualBox with OS Type "Linux / Other Linux"
-   Base Memory Size: 768 MB
-   New Hard Disk of 8 GB
-   Mount the CD-ROM with the NixOS ISO (by clicking on CD/DVD-ROM)
-   Click on Settings / Advanced (or possibly System / Processor) and
    enable PAE/NX
-   Click on Settings / Advanced (or possibly System / Acceleration) and
    enable "VT-x/AMD-V" acceleration
-   Networking: select "Attached to: NAT". Change host-interface to
    "en1: Airport".
-   Now you can install NixOS:

<!-- -->

     $ fdisk /dev/sda (create a full partition, don't skip this step, example commands for quick setup: n,p,1,w)
     $ mkfs.ext4 -j -L nixos /dev/sda1 (idem)
     $ mount LABEL=nixos /mnt
     $ mkdir -p /mnt/etc/nixos
     $ nixos-hardware-scan > /mnt/etc/nixos/configuration.nix (for quick setup overwrite configuration.nix completely with example below)
     $ nano /mnt/etc/nixos/configuration.nix

(add the fileSystems. this is what my final config looks like:)

     { config, pkgs, ...}Â :
     {
       boot.loader.grub.device = "/dev/sda";

       services.openssh.enable = true;
       services.virtualbox.enable = true;
       
       fileSystems = [
         { mountPoint = "/";
           label = "nixos";
         }
       ];
     }

Now we're ready to install!

     $ nixos-install
     $ reboot

Now you got a working nixos system.

SSH-ing into the box
--------------------

However, you can't conveniently log in to ssh this way, so you'll need
to set up port-forwarding. Doing that is explained on this site, all you
have to do is create a script named "vbox-tunnel" that contains the
following lines:

     #!/bin/bash
     cd /Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/MacOS/
     ./VBoxManage setextradata "$1" "VBoxInternal/Devices/pcnet/0/LUN#0/Config/$2/Protocol" TCP
     ./VBoxManage setextradata "$1" "VBoxInternal/Devices/pcnet/0/LUN#0/Config/$2/GuestPort" $3
     ./VBoxManage setextradata "$1" "VBoxInternal/Devices/pcnet/0/LUN#0/Config/$2/HostPort" $4

Now execute the script:

     vbox-tunnel Nix sshtunnel 22 2222

You should be able to log in to Nix now by running
`ssh -p2222 localhost` in your OS X Terminal. Enjoy!

Alternative (independent of virtual network card chosen for the guest):

     VBoxManage modifyvm "Nix" --natpf1 "sshtunnel,tcp,,2222,,22"

As before, you are now able to log in to Nix by running
`ssh -p2222 localhost` in your terminal.
