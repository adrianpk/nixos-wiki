I wanted to use my digital TV tuner in form of a USB stick. Some of the
steps I had to go through:

### Find the hardware

`$ lsusb `

    Bus 002 Device 003: ID 2040:7060 Hauppauge Nova-T Stick 2

However, `$ dmesg ` said:

    [54625.545573] usb 2-2: New USB device found, idVendor=2040, idProduct=7060
